# Pep/8 Assembly Language Linter

This is a linter designed specifically for [Pep/8 assembly language code](https://github.com/StanWarford/pep8/tree/master). The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can analyze Pep/8 assembly code for potential errors, stylistic issues, and conformity to best practices, aiding developers in writing cleaner and more error-free code.

## Features (or at least those planned): 

- **Syntax Checking:** Identify and highlight syntax errors in Pep/8 assembly code.
- **Style Enforcement:** Enforce coding conventions and best practices.
- **Error Detection:** Detect potential logical errors or problematic code structures.
- **Customization:** Allow for customizable rules and configurations.

## Installation

To use the Pep/8 Assembly Language Linter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Vianpyro/pep8-linter.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any) by running:
   ```bash
   # None, at least for the moment. This section is just so I don't forget to add them in case there are any one day.
   ```

## Usage

To lint Pep/8 assembly code using this tool:

1. Navigate to the directory where your Pep/8 assembly code is located.
2. Run the linter:
   ```bash
   # Command to run the linter
   python linter.py <your-file.pep|your-files-model>
   ```

## Configuration

The linter can be configured to suit specific needs by adjusting settings or specifying rules. Details on configuration options and how to modify them can be found in the documentation.
